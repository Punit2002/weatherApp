# Weather App

## Project Description:
The Weather App is a React-based web application that provides real-time weather information for any location around the world. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. Users can either grant location access to get the weather based on their current coordinates or search for weather in any city globally. The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, allowing easy navigation between location-based weather data and city-based searches.

## Features:
- Displays weather data based on the userâ€™s current location using geolocation.
- Search for weather in any city by typing the city name.
- Provides details such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and icons representing the weather conditions.
- Responsive UI with loading screens during API calls.
